      When reporting bugs, please follow the guidelines in this template. This helps identify the problem precisely and thus enables contributors to fix it faster.
      - Write a descriptive issue title above.
      - The golden rule is to **always open *one* issue for *one* bug**. If you notice several bugs and want to report them, make sure to create one new issue for each of them.
      - Search [open issues](https://github.com/erematorg/LP/issues) and [closed issues](https://github.com/erematorg/LP/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) to ensure it has not already been reported. If you don't find a relevant match or if you're unsure, don't hesitate to **open a new issue**. The bugsquad will handle it from there if it's a duplicate.
      - Please always check if your issue is reproducible in the latest version â€“ it may already have been fixed!

      To properly fix a bug, we need to identify if the bug was recently introduced in the LP project or if it has been present from the beginning.
      - Specify the LP version you found the issue in. If you are using a specific build, include relevant details.
      - If you can, **please test earlier LP versions** and, if applicable, newer versions. Mention whether the bug is reproducible or not in the versions you tested.
